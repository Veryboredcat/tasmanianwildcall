        The Tasmanian devil has a small, muscular build with a large head and a short, but thick tail. 
        Its size can be compared to that of a small dog (and feisty as a chihuahua). 
        They have a strong bite force relative to their size, capable of crushing bones.

    <h2>Tasmanian Devil Fun Facts</h2>
    <h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Tasmanian devils, relative to their size, have the strongest bite of any mammal in the world. 
                They can crush bones easily and even bite through metal. Their bite force is around 553 Newtons (124 lbf), 
                equivalent to a Bite Force Quotient (BFQ) of 181, also equivalent to 1200 PSI (pounds per square inch). </li>
            <br>
            <li>They can eat up to 40% of their body weight in an astonishing 30 minutes and that alone can keep them going for 2 days.</li>
            <br>
            <li>They store their body fat in their tails. If a tail is thin, it's a strong sign that it is undernourished and is starving.</li>
            <br>
            <li>They have advanced senses of smell and hearing. This in turn makes them able to look for food and other animals in the dark.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Another defense mechanism is them releasing a strong odor, which is as strong as of a skunk (which is what they are mistaken for sometimes).</li>
