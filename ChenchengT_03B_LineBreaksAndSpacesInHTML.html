    This is a recipe.
    It is about cooking, not making food.
    If I want to force a space in my code to display, I need to write the space entity &nbsp;.  
    If I write it a bunch of times, it will make spaces like this: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  
    but this is messy and time consuming. Mostly in the future we will use CSS when we want to work with line breaks, spacing, fancy layout, etc.
