    <h2>Devil Facial Tumor Disease (DFTD)</h2>
    <h3>
      Due to its current population status, the Tasmanian Devils have very low genetic variations.
      The DFTD is a major concern for the devils. Both DFT1 and DFT2 originate from Schwann cells, a type of cell that supports nerves.
      <br>
      DFTD mainly spreads through the devils fighting each other, whether it's playing, fighting for food, 
      or fighting for mating, as long as there are cuts, the disease can spread.
      <br>
      The limited genetic diversity and the spread of DFTD are the primary concerns.

      This is a map of Tasmania showing the initial site of  disease (red dot). <br>
      The curved lines show how far the disease has spread by the year devil facial tumor disease was detected in each area.

    <h2>What is being done about the DFTD</h2>
    <h3>
      Researchers are working on the development of a vaccine for the disease, 
      however most of the conservation initiatives involve protecting populations where the disease has not appeared, 
      as well as a strong focus on the ex-situ (captive) breeding program.
      <br>
      The Save the Tasmanian Devil Program (STDP) was established in response to the very real threat of extinction. 
      The STDP includes a collaboration between the Tasmanian Government and the Zoo and Aquarium Association through which an ex-situ (captive) population was established.
      The Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary has supported the STDP by breeding Tasmanian Devils as well as acting as an advocacy institution.
