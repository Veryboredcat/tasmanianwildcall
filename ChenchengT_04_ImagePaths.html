    <h1> An Image Path </h1>
    <h2> This page places an image <i>inside</i> an images folder <i>at the same level</i> as our html page, instead of floating loose at that same level of the html page </h2>
    <h3> Therefore, we must change the path to the image in our html code </h3>
    <h3> to include the images folder </h3>
    
    <!-- we have loaded our image into the images folder, which is at same level as our html file that calls that image -->
    <img src="Images/guitar.PNG" alt="A Guitar"/>
    
    <p> we are also introducing the "alt" tag </p>
    <!-- who knows what an alt tag is? Why do we use it? Write your answer below in a new <p> tag -->
    <p> It stands for "alternative text." It provides a text description of the image content. The purpose of the "alt" attribute is to provide text-based context or a description of an image for users who cannot view the image for various reasons. </p>
    
    <h4> if we had an image inside another folder that was inside the images folder <br> called "instruments," how would we code the path to it? Answer this question below this, on a new line, in h5 code. </h4>
    <h5> We should include all folders and subfolders of the image. </h5>
