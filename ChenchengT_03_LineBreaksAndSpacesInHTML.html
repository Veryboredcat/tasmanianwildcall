    This is a poem  
    Not a great poem  
    But a poem, nonetheless.  
    It uses the paragraph tag  
    And my line breaks are ignored  
    </p>

    This is a poem  
    <br>
    But a poem, nonetheless.  
    <br>
    It uses the paragraph tag  
    <br>
    With line break tags after every line  
    <br>
    To force line breaks to display  
    <br>
    Very time consuming, but it works.

    This is a poem  
    Not a great poem  
    But a poem, nonetheless.  
    It uses a pre-tag element in html  
    To force line breaks  
    But the default font is ugly  
    And will need to be styled with CSS  
    </pre>

    <p> 
    If I add 12 spaces in my body text, the browser will ignore 11 of them.  
    If I want to force a space in my code to display, I need to write the space entity &nbsp;.  
    If I write it a bunch of times, it will make spaces like this: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  
    but this is messy and time consuming. Mostly in the future we will use CSS when we want to work with line breaks, spacing, fancy layout, etc.
