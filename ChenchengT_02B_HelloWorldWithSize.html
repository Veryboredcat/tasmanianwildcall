    <h1> Hello World! </h1>

    <h2> above is a TITLE with the H1 tag. This line is coded with H2 tag </h2>
    <p> Where does the title you create in head section show up? </p>
    <!-- Answer above question in another <p> tagged line -->
    <h3> This is a subhead in h3 tag </h3>
    <p> This is some body cope with the p tag. Everything in the body section shows up on the web page,

    <p> below are two images of an orange cat. What file formats can a web browser "see"?</p>
    <!-- Answer above question in another <p> tagged line -->
    <p> File formats a web browser can see include: PNG .JPEG .PDF .doc </p>
    
    <p> the image tag in html is different: see how the opening and closing come in same line. </p>

    <img src="Cat.JPG" />
    <p> A "br" tag forces a line break in html mark-up. Later we will find </p>
    <p> better ways to cause text to jump to next line down </p>
