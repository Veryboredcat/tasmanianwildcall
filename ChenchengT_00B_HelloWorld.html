    <p>Browsers ignore line break spaces and white space in html code.
    This paragraph and the footer's text can be written in one line, or broken up into multiple code lines. But the browser will display this paragraph text as wide as the browser window before it jumps to next line, and the footer, not such a long line of text, will display as one line even if you write it in two code line. Also note no white space between this paragraph and the footer.</p>
