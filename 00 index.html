    <h3>  Around 3,000 years ago Tasmanian Devils became extinct on mainland Australia (This was mainly due to dingoes, early humans, and climate changes). 
        Wild Tasmanian Devils are now only found naturally in Tasmania. 
        <br>
        <br>
          The Tasmanian Devil is the world’s largest surviving marsupial carnivore. 
        Sadly, the Tasmanian Devil has undergone a massive decline in numbers due to the Devil Facial Tumor Disease (DFTD), 
        with over 90% of the overall Tasmanian Devil population lost to this terrible disease.
        <br>

        <br>  
        This contagious cancer, which was first discovered in 1996, causes tumors on the face and around the mouth, 
        making it difficult for devils to eat and survive. 
        DFTD is almost always fatal and has led to a significant decline in the Tasmanian devil population.
        <br>
        The devil population has been reduced by several historical population bottlenecks, resulting in a lack of genetic diversity. 
        This means that they are more susceptible to diseases like DFTD, as their immune systems have difficulty recognizing and fighting the cancer.
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Pre-DFTD (early 1990s): Estimated 150,000–200,000 individuals. </li>
          <li>Post-DFTD (by 2020s): Estimated 20,000–25,000 individuals in the wild.</li>
        </ul>
